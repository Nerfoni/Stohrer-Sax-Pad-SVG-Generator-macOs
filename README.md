# Stohrer-Sax-Pad-SVG-Generator
Generates SVGs for laser cutting saxophone felts, cards, and leathers.  Current version is 1.01.

Features: SVG creation, layout in proscribed space (unless it won't fit), save presets, delete presets.  

Windows only for now.  

Should work for leather between .011"- .014", and sizing of leather disc assumes a .125" thick felt with cardstock between .010 and .025 being acceptable for overwrap, providing for a final pad thickness of .160" to .175" or so, but YMMV.

You will need to apply your own feeds/speeds and kerf settings depending on your cutter in Lightburn. SVGs may not present correctly in other apps (especially default image viewers).  

I have no idea how to code, I had chatgpt make this for me and stumbled through.  

Make sure to enter the pad sizes like it suggests, e.g. "34.0 x 10" without the quotes, and each size on a different line. 

Click on "releases" and download the exe.  https://github.com/stohrermusic/Stohrer-Sax-Pad-SVG-Generator/releases/tag/saxophone

Put the .exe in a folder.  Your presets will be saved in a json file in that folder.  

Hope it works for you!
