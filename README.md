# Stohrer-Sax-Pad-SVG-Generator
Generates SVGs for laser cutting saxophone felts, cards, and leathers.  

You will need to apply your own feeds/speeds and kerf settings depending on your cutter in lightburn. 

I have no idea how to code, I had chatgpt make this for me and stumbled through.  

make sure to enter the pad sizes like it suggests, e.g. "34.0 x 10" without the quotes, and each size on a different line

Hope it works for you!
